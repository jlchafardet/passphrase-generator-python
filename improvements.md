# Improvements for Passphrase Generator

- ~~User Input Validation~~
  - ~~Implement validation for the `num_words` argument to ensure it is a positive integer and does not exceed the number of available words in the list.~~
  - ~~Validate the `special_chars` argument to ensure it only accepts 'true' or 'false'.~~

- Enhanced Word List Management
  - Allow users to specify a custom word list file via command-line arguments, providing flexibility in word selection.
  - Implement a feature to automatically clean and format the word list file (removing duplicates, special characters, etc.) before generating passphrases.

- Passphrase Complexity Options
  - Introduce additional options for passphrase complexity, such as including numbers, symbols, or varying capitalization patterns beyond just the first letter.
  - Allow users to specify the minimum and maximum length of the generated passphrase.

- User Interface Improvements
  - Consider creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for users who may not be comfortable with command-line operations.
  - Provide clear instructions and examples in the command-line help message.

- Logging and History
  - Implement logging to keep track of generated passphrases for user reference, with options to save or export them securely.
  - Allow users to view a history of generated passphrases during the session.

- ~~Strength Assessment~~
  - ~~Add a feature to assess the strength of the generated passphrase and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.~~
  - ~~Implement random capitalization of characters to enhance passphrase strength.~~

- Testing and Documentation
  - Create unit tests to ensure the functionality works as expected and to validate edge cases.
  - Update the README.md file to include detailed usage instructions, examples, and explanations of the new features.

- ~~Error Handling~~
  - ~~Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues, such as file not found errors or invalid input formats, and provide user-friendly error messages.~~

- Internationalization
  - Consider supporting multiple languages for the word list and user interface to cater to a broader audience.

- ~~Performance Optimization~~
  - ~~Analyze the performance of the word selection and passphrase generation process, optimizing for larger word lists or more complex generation criteria.~~
